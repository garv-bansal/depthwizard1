# Benchmarking DepthWizard against reference LiDAR

The accuracy half of the marking scheme (50%) asks for RMSE, MAE and correlation
against reference data, and for stability across urban, sparse, hilly and
forested landscapes. This directory produces exactly that, as
`mathsandml/benchmark/results/report.md`.

Everything here runs on your Mac. The pipeline needs the Depth-Anything weights
and the reference services need the open internet, and neither is reachable
from the cloud sandbox this was prepared in.

## 0. The short version

```bash
# on a machine with the internet and the model (double-click run_on_mac.command
# on a Mac): fetch missing scenes, run the backbone once per scene, cache DEMs
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --source ahn       --out mathsandml/benchmark/scenes
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --source swisstopo --out mathsandml/benchmark/scenes
python mathsandml/benchmark/warm_cache.py --scenes mathsandml/benchmark/scenes

# anywhere after that - no model, no network needed, seconds per scene
python mathsandml/benchmark/run_benchmark.py --scenes mathsandml/benchmark/scenes \
       --out mathsandml/benchmark/results \
       --scale-source known-height --compare gcps-from-ref --loso-gain
```

`run_all.sh` does all of it in one go. Existing scenes are never re-downloaded
(`REFETCH=1` to force it), and a scene.json someone has annotated is never
overwritten - an earlier version did both, which silently deleted every
hand-entered prior and failed the next benchmark on every scene.

## 1. One-time setup

```bash
cd depthwizard
source .venv/bin/activate          # the venv already has torch + rasterio
pip install -r requirements.txt    # no-op if it is already current
```

The OpenTopography key is already saved in `depthwizard/.env`, and
`run_benchmark.py` loads it before importing `inference` — which matters,
because `inference.py` binds `OPENTOPO_KEY` at import time, so a key exported
later would be read as empty and the DEM fetch would silently degrade. A real
environment variable still wins over the file, and `.env` is in `.gitignore`.

The key was verified live: a request with a deliberately invalid bounding box
came back with a bbox complaint rather than an auth error, which is what a
working key looks like.

Without a key the pipeline still runs — it just outputs height above local
ground instead of height above sea level, and the benchmark scores it against
the reference nDSM instead of the reference DSM. Both are legitimate; see §5.

## 2. Get the reference data

```bash
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --check       # probe every service, download nothing
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --list        # show the built-in areas of interest
```

`--check` is the first thing to run. It prints which service answered and which
layer or coverage name it discovered. If a name has drifted since this was
written, `--check` shows you what the service *does* publish and you adjust one
regex in the `SOURCES` table at the top of `fetch_data.py`.

Then fetch:

```bash
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --source ahn        --out mathsandml/benchmark/scenes
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --source swisstopo  --out mathsandml/benchmark/scenes
python mathsandml/benchmark/fetch_data.py --source usgs       --out mathsandml/benchmark/scenes
```

Default footprint is 300 m square at 0.5 m GSD, i.e. 600 x 600 px — about the
size of the images already in `jobs/`, and a sane first run on CPU. `--size-m`
and `--px` change that.

Default footprint is capped by the services: PDOK's WMS refuses anything over
2500 x 2500 px, so at 0.5 m GSD the largest AHN scene is 1250 m. The fetcher
checks this before requesting and says so rather than letting the service
return an exception page.

### What each source gives you

All four services below were probed live on 2026-09-03 and the names in the
table are what they actually publish today, not guesses.

| Source | Reference | Imagery | CRS | Covers |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `ahn` | AHN4 `dsm_05m` **and** `dtm_05m`, 0.5 m, ≥10 pts/m², flown 2020–22 | `Actueel_orthoHR`, 8 cm | EPSG:28992 | urban, sparse |
| `swisstopo` | swissSURFACE3D Raster **and** swissALTI3D terrain, 0.5 m COG tiles | SWISSIMAGE 10 cm | EPSG:2056 | urban, sparse, hilly, forest |
| `usgs` | 3DEP, 1 m — **bare earth**, self-described | NAIP | EPSG:3857 | hilly |

Three things that probing turned up, all now handled in code:

- PDOK's orthophoto WMS advertises **`image/jpeg` and nothing else**. A
  hard-coded PNG request comes back as a ServiceException, so the format is
  read from GetCapabilities and the best offered one is used.
- AHN's WCS accepts **EPSG:28992 only** and **GEOTIFF only**.
- swisstopo publishes **1 km² tiles**, so a 300 m AOI can straddle two or four
  of them, and each tile exists at several resolutions (SWISSIMAGE ships 0.1 m
  *and* 2.0 m). The fetcher mosaics every tile covering the AOI, keeps the
  newest revision of each, picks the finest `eo:gsd` asset, and warns if any
  part of the footprint had no coverage.

AHN is the strongest pairing: a true LiDAR surface model *and* a terrain model,
so the reference nDSM is a real measured difference rather than a low-pass
approximation. Start there.

USGS 3DEP is a **bare-earth** product. A USGS scene therefore scores terrain
reconstruction, not building heights, and `scene.json` records
`bare_earth_reference: true` so you don't read the urban row the wrong way.

### If a service is down or renamed

Any pair of overlapping rasters works. Drop them in by hand:

```
mathsandml/benchmark/scenes/<name>/rgb.tif       georeferenced optical image (must have a CRS)
mathsandml/benchmark/scenes/<name>/ref_dsm.tif   reference surface model
mathsandml/benchmark/scenes/<name>/ref_dtm.tif   optional terrain model
mathsandml/benchmark/scenes/<name>/scene.json    optional: {"landscape": "urban", "known_height_m": 40}
```

Manual sources, no scripting needed:

- **AHN** — <https://www.ahn.nl/ahn-viewer>, draw a box, download the 0.5 m DSM
  and DTM tiles. Orthophoto from <https://www.pdok.nl> ("Luchtfoto Actueel
  Ortho 8cm RGB").
- **swisstopo** — <https://www.swisstopo.admin.ch/en/geodata/height/surface3d.html>
  for the DSM, SWISSIMAGE from the same download portal.
- **ISPRS Vaihingen / Potsdam** — <https://www.isprs.org/education/benchmarks/UrbanSemLab/>.
  Needs a registration form, which is why it is not scripted. It ships an
  orthophoto plus a published nDSM, so save the nDSM as `ref_dsm.tif` and a
  zero raster as `ref_dtm.tif`, or just leave the DTM out and let the low-pass
  fallback handle it. This is the one source with numbers in the literature to
  compare against.

The only hard requirement is that `rgb.tif` carries a CRS and a transform. If
it doesn't, the pipeline drops to relative mode and there is nothing metric to
score — the runner reports that per scene rather than producing a meaningless
number.

## 3. Run the benchmark

```bash
python mathsandml/benchmark/run_benchmark.py --scenes mathsandml/benchmark/scenes --out mathsandml/benchmark/results
```

On CPU with the Large backbone, budget a few minutes per 600 x 600 scene. To
sanity-check the plumbing first:

```bash
DEPTH_MODEL=depth-anything/Depth-Anything-V2-Small-hf \
  python mathsandml/benchmark/run_benchmark.py --limit 1 --no-figures
```

Then the real run. `--use-dem` is on by default and the key is in place, so the
output is an absolute sea-level DSM scored against the reference DSM. Add
`--no-dem` to score height-above-ground against the reference nDSM instead —
useful for isolating structure accuracy from terrain. If the DEM fetch fails
for any reason the run does not break: it falls back to height-above-ground and
the report says which datum each scene was scored on.

Outputs:

```
mathsandml/benchmark/results/report.md      the tables below, ready to paste
mathsandml/benchmark/results/results.json   every metric, plus the control points used
mathsandml/benchmark/results/<scene>/       dsm.tif, ndsm.tif, dtm.tif, validation.md,
                                 error_map.png, scatter.png, stability.png
```

## 4. Choosing how scale is set

`estimate_elevation` cannot invent absolute scale — the README's "known limits"
explains why the coarse DEM can't supply it. So the benchmark has to declare
where scale came from, and `--scale-source` controls that.

| Flag | What it does | Independence |
|---|---|---|
| `known-height` *(default, and the headline)* | one semantic prior per scene from `scene.json`, read off the ortho | good - no reference elevation enters calibration |
| `gcps-from-ref` | samples 8 control points from the reference nDSM, one per grid cell | **none** - a diagnostic of the pipeline's ceiling, never a headline |
| `shadow` | sun azimuth + elevation, from `scene.json` or the GeoTIFF tags | **full** — no reference data enters calibration |
| `ghsl` | GHSL building height under the scene (`mathsandml/ghsl.py`), no person involved | good - an external global product, never the reference |
| `scene` | whatever each `scene.json` specifies | mixed |

The headline uses `known-height`: one number per scene - roughly how tall the
tallest sustained structure is - read off the orthophoto and written into
`scene.json` with where it came from. No reference elevation enters the
calibration, so the headline is an honest answer to "what happens on an image
nobody has LiDAR for".

`--compare gcps-from-ref` scores the same scenes again with 8 control points
sampled from the reference, as a clearly labelled second table. Those points
come from the raster used for scoring, so that table is the pipeline's ceiling
with perfect anchors, not an accuracy claim.

`--scale-source shadow` needs sun azimuth and elevation. None of the benchmark
orthophotos carries an acquisition time, so the shadow calibrator is covered
by the synthetic scenes in `tests.py` (it recovers a known scale to within 4%
at every sun angle tested) but has no LiDAR-scored number yet. Say so if asked.

A person's `known_height_m` is used as given with the default envelope split
(`DEPTHWIZARD_PRIOR_GAIN=1.0`, measured - see the README). Scores from
2026-09-25 used the old Gaussian split with a x0.80 correction; reproduce them
with `DEPTHWIZARD_SPLIT=gauss DEPTHWIZARD_DEM_MAX_M=none`. `--scale-source
ghsl` is what an image nobody has looked at gets. Its own factor
(`DEPTHWIZARD_GHSL_GAIN`) is 1.0 by measurement: fitted held-out, no single
factor transferred between the five scenes GHSL covers (README). The GHSL
tiles must be on disk - `fetch_ghsl.command` or `warm_cache.py`.

`--loso-gain` asks whether one global correction on alpha generalises: each
scene's gain is fitted on the OTHER scenes only and scored on the held-out one.
A gain fitted and scored on the same scene always looks good; this is the test
that it would help on a scene it has never seen.

---

## 5. Reading the report

**Per-scene accuracy** is the headline RMSE / MAE / correlation. `NSE`
(Nash–Sutcliffe) is there because `r` alone is generous: a prediction with the
wrong scale and a large bias can still correlate at 0.95. NSE punishes both.

**Structure heights only (object band)** removes the terrain baseline from both
sides. This isolates what the depth model contributes, and its
`suggested alpha gain` closes the loop back into the pipeline — re-run with
`--alpha-gain <median>` to correct the systematic attenuation the frequency
split introduces.

**Stability across landscape types** is the stratified table the marking scheme
asks for. Classes are proxies derived from the reference surface and the
imagery — roughness, excess green, low-frequency relief — not a land-cover
product, and the report says so. Forest will be the worst row: a DSM returns
canopy, and the pipeline has no way to see through it. That is a known limit,
not a bug, and it is better to name it than to have it found.

**What is scored against what** matters and the report states it per run:

- `--use-dem` on, and the DEM fetch succeeded → the output is an absolute
  surface, scored against `ref_dsm.tif`.
- otherwise → the output is height above local ground, scored against the
  reference nDSM (`ref_dsm - ref_dtm`, or a low-pass residual if no DTM).

Scoring height-above-ground against an absolute sea-level DSM would be
comparing two different quantities, and the terrain the prediction never
claimed to know would dominate the error. The runner will not do it.

---

## 6. Known sharp edges

- **Object/terrain split vs building size.** The split is set from the DEM
  resolution (`DEM_RES_M / px / 2`), which at 0.5 m GSD is a 15 m low-pass.
  Buildings wider than roughly 30 m are partly absorbed into "terrain" and come
  back attenuated. The `height ratio` column measures it; `--sigma-m` and
  `--alpha-gain` are the levers. On synthetic scenes built from large blocks
  this alone accounted for most of the error.
- **GCP fitting is sensitive.** `alpha_from_gcps` fits a slope through
  control points on the detail band, and when structures are attenuated the
  fitted alpha gets large and amplifies noise everywhere. If a scene reports a
  wild `alpha` in `results.json`, or a high `clipped_negative_frac`, try
  `--scale-source known-height` for that scene.
- **Forest is canopy.** Expect the forest row to be the worst. Say so first.
